## Reflection

This was a coding challenge. Project goals included listing the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days. As to fetch the JSON data from the Github API.

I started by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, Intersection Observer API to keep track of the last repo in the page, Antd to speed up the styling and Axios because it is easier to handle than fetch and more supported.
